**The Atlas of Heritage Trees**
is an archive of ancient trees
of exceptional historical, cultural, and ecological significance.
The trees, captured using terrestrial laser scanning,
have been archived in
``laz``, ``e57``, ``pcd``, ``ply``, ``xyz``, and ``3dm`` format point clouds.
The project leads are [Brendan Harmon](https://baharmon.github.io/)
and [Hye Yeon Nam](https://hynam.org/).

This project was funded by the 
LSU Big Ideas Grant and the
LSU Arts & Humanities Support Fund.
It was supported by the LSU Center for GeoInformatics
and the LSU Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio.
