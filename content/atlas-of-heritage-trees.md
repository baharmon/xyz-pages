**The Atlas of Heritage Trees**
is an archive of ancient trees
of exceptional historical, cultural, and ecological significance.
The trees, captured using terrestrial laser scanning and drone lidar,
have been archived in
``laz``, ``e57``, ``pcd``, ``xyz``, and ``3dm`` format point clouds.
This project was funded by the LSU Arts & Humanities Support Fund.
The project leads are [Brendan Harmon](https://baharmon.github.io/)
and [Hye Yeon Nam](https://hynam.org/).
Contributors include 
Javier Zamora, 
Huan Guo, 
William Reinhardt, 
Julie Whitbeck, 
Kaiti Fink, 
and Jeff Boucher.
The point clouds are released under the
