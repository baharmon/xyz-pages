Welcome to **XYZ Project**,
a collection of point clouds from laser scanning and photogrammetry
by Louisiana State University's
[College of Art and Design](https://design.lsu.edu/).

**Rosedown Plantation, St. Francisville, Louisiana**

Rosedown is a two hundred acre site in St. Francisville, Louisiana
with the well preserved remains of an antebellum plantation dating from 1834
including the main house, ancillary buildings, and formal gardens.
The point cloud of Rosedown was created
using terrestrial laser scanning with a Faro Focus
and drone photogrammetry with a DJI Matrice 600 Pro with Zenmuse X5 camera.
The project was lead by
[Brendan Harmon](https://baharmon.github.io/) and
[Nicholas Serrano](https://design.lsu.edu/faculty/serrano-nicholas/).
The team included Josef Horacek, Sasha Matthieu, William Conrad,
Javier Zamora, Matthew Cranney, and Ming Li.
This project was supported by the
[LSU Center for GeoInformatics](http://c4g.lsu.edu/) and
[LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio](https://css.lsu.edu/)
and funded by the
[National Park Service's Historic Preservation Fund](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/historicpreservationfund/index.htm).

**Hilltop Arboretum, Baton Rouge, Louisiana**

A Cajun Prairie Wildflower Meadow was established in 2020 at the
[LSU Hilltop Arboretum](https://www.lsu.edu/hilltop/)
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Five fields have been restored as coastal tallgrass prairie,
a highly endangered ecosystem of which only one percent remains intact.
The evolution of the newly established meadow was recorded
with a series of monthly aerial surveys
by a drone with a multispectral sensor.
Net annual biomass and carbon
were computed from the time series of point clouds.
The team lead for this project was
[Brendan Harmon](https://baharmon.github.io/).
The team included Josef Horacek, Dan Cooke, and Matthew Cranney.
The surveys were conducted with a
FireFLY Pro 6 fixed wing drone
with a MicaSense RedEdge-M sensor
and 9 permanent ground control points.
This project was supported by the
[LSU Center for GeoInformatics](http://c4g.lsu.edu/).
