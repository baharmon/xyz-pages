**Rosedown** is a two hundred acre site in St. Francisville, Louisiana
with the well preserved remains of an antebellum plantation dating from 1834
including the main house, ancillary buildings, and formal gardens.
The point cloud of Rosedown was created
using terrestrial laser scanning with a Faro Focus
and drone photogrammetry with a DJI Matrice 600 Pro with Zenmuse X5 camera.
The project was lead by
[Brendan Harmon](https://baharmon.github.io/) and
[Nicholas Serrano](https://design.lsu.edu/faculty/serrano-nicholas/).
The team included Josef Horacek, Sasha Matthieu, William Conrad,
Javier Zamora, Matthew Cranney, and Ming Li.
This project was supported by the
[LSU Center for GeoInformatics](http://c4g.lsu.edu/) and
[LSU Coastal Sustainability Studio](https://css.lsu.edu/)
and funded by the National Park Service's Historic Preservation Fund.

**Point Cloud Viewer**

The model of Rosedown is composed of
many separate point clouds,
each recording an important element
of the plantation.
This point cloud viewer presents
the collection as an ensemble
that can be explored by
toggling on or off layers.
Open the viewer,
expand its menu,
then expand the scene tab, and
turn point cloud layers on or off.
